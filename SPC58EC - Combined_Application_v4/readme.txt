AEK_POW_BMS63EN 

The aim of this demo is to provide an example that show how it works an Automotive Battery Management Systems (BMS) that manages 
a battery pack with 14 Li-ion battery cells LG INR 18650 MJ1.

AEK_POW_BMS63EN is able to meet critical features such as voltage, temperature and current monitoring, battery state of charge (SoC),  
battery state of health (SOH) and cell balancing of lithium-ion (Li-ion) batteries. 

The State of Charge (SOH) and State of Health (SOH) algorithm is based on an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) implemented by using Model Based Design approach.
Starting from a Simulink Model the C-code has been generated by using Mathworks Embedded coder customized for 32bit MCU

This demo application requires AEK-COM-ISOSPI1 tranceiver which is able to define an ISOSPI communication beetween MCU and AEK-POW-BMS63EN
